# Ski Game

This is cereos version of the classic Windows game SkiFree. If
you've never heard of SkiFree, Google has plenty of examples.

You can deploy it locally by running:
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

**How To Play**

* Use the arrow keys to turn the skier.
* Use Spacebar to jump over an obstacle. You can only jump over a rock.
* There are jump ramps in the game if you hit a jump ramp the skier will jump automatically.
* The skier will crash if they hit an obstacle. Use the left/right keys to move away from the obstacle and then down
to resume skiing.
* At some point the rhino will appear, chasing the skier. It will inevitably catch the skier and eat them, ending the
game.
* You can find an online version of the game here: https://cereos-ski.herokuapp.com/
